# Mario-Paint-Game

Harry Wang - 1A ECE University of Waterloo

In this game, it is used so that users can manipulate the Mario character and paint set pictures on the board. The board and paints are made as seperate files within 
the files that are uploaded in the repository. 

This is a fun interactive game that I create for fun so that students I was teaching as teaching assistant could get a feel of how coding beyond simple conditional
loops looks like.
